# Playbooks in the Dark

This is a modular character sheet for the [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/) RPG system and other [Forged in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/forged-dark) games.

You can find it running at [thedark.iswhywecanthavenicethings.fyi](https://thedark.iswhywecanthavenicethings.fyi/).

## What is this?

Blades in the Dark is an excellent system and the various Forged in the Dark games extend it excellently. There's a few really good online character sheets out there, but they only support the base game.

The goal of this project is to take advantage of the common elements between BitD and FitD to make setting up new systems, characters, crews, etc as easy as possible.

## What this isn't

This is not a VTT - players will still need to know what each of the elements on the sheet represents, what dice to roll, when to click or unclick things.

This project optimizes for flexibility at the expense of depth. Because of this, certain bits of the character sheet might not look like the original PDFs.

## How do I set up new systems / playbook types?

Until proper docs are set up, I recommend looking at what's already there in the `/systems` folder.

## Rough roadmap

Running up to a beta release:

- [x] set up production site
- [ ] data entry for BitD characters
- [ ] add BitD crews
- [ ] add mobile support
- [ ] add the first non-bitd system

Future:

- [ ] add support for Deep Cuts content
- [ ] translation support
